# Research field


| Interest | Description | 
| -------- | ---------- |
| Embodied Intelligence | Embodied intelligence is a form of artificial intelligence that interacts directly with the environment through physical agents, simulating the perception and motor abilities of humans or animals. This form of intelligence emphasizes the interaction between perception and action, learning and adapting through real-time interaction with the physical world, in contrast to traditional, non-embodied intelligence that relies solely on pre-collected datasets for learning. Research areas of embodied intelligence include but are not limited to robotics, natural language processing, computer vision, machine learning, cognitive science, and human-computer interaction, aiming to create intelligent agents capable of understanding and influencing their surrounding world. I am interested in embodied intelligence, which stems from my admiration for the Iron Man series of movies, and I really hope that robots similar to "Jarvis" will emerge in various industries in the future. To me, embodied intelligence represents a frontier and revolutionary direction in the field of artificial intelligence, challenging and expanding the boundaries of traditional AI. Embodied intelligence, by enabling machines to perceive, learn, and act in the physical world, mimicking the way humans or animals interact with the environment, opens up new possibilities for research and applications. It involves not only technological and engineering breakthroughs but also a deep understanding and application of principles from cognitive science, psychology, and biology, providing new perspectives and tools for creating more natural and effective human-computer interaction. I hope to have the opportunity to work in related fields such as robotics and human-computer interaction in the future, and I am very eager to contribute to this revolutionary field of embodied intelligence. |
