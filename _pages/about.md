# Research field

| Interest | Description | 
| -------- | ---------- |
| AIoT | **AIoT** (Artificial Intelligence of Things) is the convergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT), allowing smart devices to not only communicate but also analyze data, learn from it, and make autonomous decisions. This integration enables IoT devices to go beyond simple data collection and transmission, allowing knowledge to be applied in real-world situations. **Research areas of AIoT** include but are not limited to smart cities, industrial automation, healthcare, and connected vehicles. **I am particularly interested in** the potential of AIoT to revolutionize industries by creating adaptive, intelligent systems that interact seamlessly with their surroundings. **To me**, AIoT represents a way to make academic knowledge practical and tangible, **integrating advanced technology into daily life**. AIoT marks the next step in the evolution of smart systems, with the ability to transform everything from infrastructure to personal devices. I am eager to contribute to the development and application of AIoT technologies, leveraging its potential to create smarter, more efficient, and responsive environments. |
| Embodied Intelligence | **Embodied intelligence is a form of artificial intelligence that interacts directly with the environment through physical agents, simulating the perception and motor abilities of humans or animals.** This form of intelligence emphasizes the interaction between perception and action, learning and adapting through real-time interaction with the physical world, in contrast to traditional, non-embodied intelligence that relies solely on pre-collected datasets for learning. Research areas of embodied intelligence include but are not limited to robotics, natural language processing, computer vision, machine learning, cognitive science, and human-computer interaction, aiming to create intelligent agents capable of understanding and influencing their surrounding world. **I am interested in embodied intelligence, which stems from my admiration for the Iron Man series of movies, and I really hope that robots similar to "Jarvis" will emerge in various industries in the future. To me, embodied intelligence represents a frontier and revolutionary direction in the field of artificial intelligence, challenging and expanding the boundaries of traditional AI.** Embodied intelligence, by enabling machines to perceive, learn, and act in the physical world, mimicking the way humans or animals interact with the environment, opens up new possibilities for research and applications. It involves not only technological and engineering breakthroughs but also a deep understanding and application of principles from cognitive science, psychology, and biology, providing new perspectives and tools for creating more natural and effective human-computer interaction. **I hope to have the opportunity to work in related fields such as robotics and human-computer interaction in the future, and I am very eager to contribute to this revolutionary field of embodied intelligence.** |

The mini-program was successfully launched, and the project won<br> the Telecommunications Institute Challenge Cup. |



### Smart Campus - WeLink Mini Program (We Code)

| Time | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 2021.08-2021.10 | I was the founder and leader of this project, which eventually produced<br> a frontend demo of a mini-program that was not launched.<br> **Background**: The rapid growth in the number of WeLink users<br> presented us with an opportunity. WeLink has served over 700,000 <br>organizations, including government, enterprises, education, and <br>healthcare sectors. However, there was a lack of a dedicated <br>application tailored to the usage habits of contemporary college students. <br>**Project Content**: To develop a WeLink mini-program, the frontend <br>was implemented using HTML5+CSS+JavaScript+WeLink API (completed), <br>and the backend was planned to be developed using SpringBoot+MySQL. <br>**Personal Contribution**: I coordinated with teammates to produce<br> materials such as business plans, presentations, and videos.<br> Additionally, I participated in the development of the WeLink mini-program <br>frontend. I successfully led the team to participate in <br>the "Internet+" Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition, <br>and the team was awarded the provincial-level bronze medal. |



### Database Systems Major Project
